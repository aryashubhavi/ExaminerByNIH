You will be shown a series of screens containing blue circles, 
green circles, and blue squares.

Please count and remember the number of BLUE CIRCLES 
you see on each screen.  

Count the BLUE CIRCLES out loud, one at a time, 
and then repeat the final total out loud immediately.
This will indicate to the examiner that you have finished counting.
