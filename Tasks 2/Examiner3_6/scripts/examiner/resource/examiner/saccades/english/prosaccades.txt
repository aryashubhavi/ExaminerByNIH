We are going to do a task to watch  your eye movements. 

You will see a dot in the center of the screen.

Move your eyes in the direction the dot moves, which will
be either to the left side or to the right side of the screen. 

After you have looked in the direction of the dot, 
return your eyes to the center of the screen. 

Do not move your head, just your eyes.

Press the SPACEBAR to continue.
