Now we will move on to the second part of this eye movement task.
Again, you will see a dot in the center of the screen. 

This time I would like you to use your eyes to look 
in the OPPOSITE direction of where the dot moves.

Do not move your head, just your eyes. 

After looking at the opposite side of where the dot is, 
return your eyes to look at the dot at the center of the screen. 

Press the SPACEBAR to begin the practice trial.
