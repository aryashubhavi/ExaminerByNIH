Now, you will count the BLUE CIRCLES on one screen, 
and then on another screen. 

Please begin counting the blue circles out loud as 
soon as they appear on each screen. 

Remember to repeat the final total out loud once 
you have finished counting. 

After a number of screens you will see question marks.
This will be your cue to repeat the final totals you 
counted on each screen in the correct order. 

Let's do some practice first. Press the SPACEBAR to begin.
